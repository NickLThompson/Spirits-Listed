## Status

The status of this website is a success! Lacy, Serge, and I worked relentlessly

on this project and the outcome was very satisfying to see. I am really proud

of my team and myself, as I have found that having teammates really helps in

something like coding. There were a lot of challenges that I definitely would

not have been able to overcome had I not had them there to help me. We all 3

put hours and hours of work into this, and it's really made me feel a lot more 

confident in my own work since I'm 1/3rd of this project's work.
